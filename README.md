# my-programming-font

This is my programming font, based on final fantasy VIII fonts. I change it to monospace, and modified some glyph to distinct between characters

I use https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/editfont.php to create my ttf font, and then convert it using font forge into bitmap font
